                My goal for this project was to combine Python code and a SQL database into one.<br>
                <br>
                I had various ideas on what to do, some of these ideas included Libary Management System
                or a Bank Management System. However i settled on the idea of a Student Management System<br>
                <br>
                This was by far the most challenging project i have worked on till this date, (16/9/2023)
                Having only really learnt Python and SQL for around 4 weeks. However this didnt deter me
                from pushing myself to see what i could do.<br>
                <br>
                I started by creating the database and laying down the funadmentals for a Python app and 
                then creating the functions, i.e Logging student data and courses. I then finished off by
                polishing up the way it looked with custom Tkinter<br>
                <br>
                Although i make it sound very straight forward it was far from it, i had many struggles and 
                setbacks, one of them being that i had only discovered custom Tkinter halfway through so i 
                had to go back and re design everything i had previously built.<br>
                <br>
                If i had to re-do it all again i would definetly considering designing the layout before i 
                had started. Overall howerver this was a very fun project to work on and i look forward to 
                doing similar stuff with SQL and Python
